Machine learning is the ability of machines 
to predict outcomes without being explicitly 
programmed to do so. It is about creating and 
implementing algorithms that let machines 
receive data and use this data to:
• Make predictions
• Analyse patterns
• Give recommendations
AI simulates human knowledge and decision making with computers. 
Humans have managed to reach AI through machine and deep learning.
